# Epic Quest Server

This project is a proof-of-concept for how one could create a multi-user game
using NodeJS and Electron. The overall goal is to create a game similar to
Pokemon (top-down RPG, collecting and leveling monsters) but with more
immersive multiplayer functionality (such as PvP).


This repository hosts the server; the client is available at
https://github.com/b-turchyn/EpicQuestClient.

# Requirements

* MySQL / MariaDB Server
* NodeJS

# Installation

`npm install`

# Running

In development, simply run `node index.js`. Production will require further
configuration.
